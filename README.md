# Korean Learning Tool

## Introduction
Welcome to this small script, that I build in order to progress my understanding of Korean. Feel free to fork this project and word you feel you'd like to remember.

The motivation behind this project, was just being able to quickly and rapidly move through a few korean words without having to navigate the annoyance of browsing on the web. This scipt is therefore perfect for the average developer that would like to learn korean.

## Usage
Simply run the python 3 script: korean_practice.py, and boom you're all done. That simple.
